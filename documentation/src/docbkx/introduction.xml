  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The Geomajas Geometry Project is a stand-alone project under the
  Geomajas banner. It's goal is to provide a small and efficient geometry
  model to be used mainly in web environments or as Data Transfer Objects. As
  an example, the geometry object itself is as basic as possible, while a list
  of services provide the functionality.</para>

  <para>This geometry model is meant to be used in GWT environments, or as the
  DTO counterpart to JTS or some other rich library, or both. As the
  dependencies for this project have been kept at a minimum, this geometry
  model can easily be used within GIS domain models on the web.</para>
